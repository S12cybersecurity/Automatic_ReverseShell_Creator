# Automatic Reverse Shell Creator
Bash Script to Automate Shell conection in Linux Systems

**How Works?**

Basically with the which command it identifies the utilities that the system does have installed, to which one it finds it sends you a reverse shell with itself

There are 5 commands that this script looks for:

- bash

- python, python2 or python3

- perl

- php

- nc

S12 :)

Thanks.
